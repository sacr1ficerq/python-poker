    New format for state()
    
    Introduced new formats for states: TableData, PlayerData, RoundData.
    Dataclasses can be converted to dict with asdict(). And thus become
    easily serializable.
    It allows for a much smoother refactoring expirience and sync between backend and
    frontend. Also much nicer testing experience.
    Added some tests.
